probably the most primitive way to send string to arduino, but still. practically its my hello world in python so undoubtedly it could be 
written better. I havent seen much tutorials about this topic, so here is my example

it has one (probably one that i discovered yet) major bug, the thing is
you can only send string once, and then you have to restart the whole thing

#### if anybody wants to use this example (i fell sorry for you) remember to set the correct COM port in app.py, plus you have to first run the arduino and then you can run app.py, serial monitor and app.py cant be launched in the same time
